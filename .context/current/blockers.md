# Current blockers and open risks

1. No second physical PC tested: cross-network operation, real remote Windows sessions and deployment remain **not proven**.
2. Router Lite is not activated in the live DOMKAT tunnel; isolated test build only. Deployment and safe agent configuration/autostart remain open.
3. Agent authentication currently uses one shared secret supplied through environment variables. Next phase should support protected per-agent credentials and straightforward onboarding without added database/infrastructure.
4. 16 MiB wire message limit exists. Oversized responses fail explicitly; high-resolution screenshot size and network latency on a second PC need empirical validation.
5. Remote GUI actions require a user session on that PC. Server or locked-session behavior has not been tested.

The local routing, controls and reconnection tests passed; these risks do not invalidate that narrower evidence.

6. Agent installer Setup/Update v0.1.0 was compiled/tested/published on Windows GitHub Actions; next blocker is real deployment on second physical Windows PC.
7. Protected per-user DPAPI secret is functional for the client; Router Lite still requires the same manually configured shared secret server-side. A second physical PC has not been onboarded.

## Same-tunnel transition risk
- Current MCP channel is the old DOMKAT tunnel. Cutover will temporarily disconnect ChatGPT; independent local script and verified installer must be staged first.
- Owner's replacement runtime key is not available and must be entered directly into new server GUI.
- Keep the Git source repository even when removing installed old executable/profile and scheduled task.

## Post-recovery follow-up
- No current DOMKAT outage: original ChatGPT Tunnel connection and Router Lite are working.
- Published v0.2.1 installer still has the native stderr redirection bug. v0.2.2 release is needed before next update.
- Client MKATUSHONOK has not yet been verified through the new live Router Lite; tool metadata refresh may be needed for newly added computers.list tool in ChatGPT.
